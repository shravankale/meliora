Prompt: Implement a python program for me using the Stack based Naive Method described in the following document https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2019/cs7260_spring/lecture30.pdf#:~:text=Reuse%20distance%20is%20the%20number%20of%20distinct%20memory,was%20the%20last%20time%20you%20used%20this%20address.

This program includes a `main` method that creates an instance of the `ReuseDistance` class and processes a list of addresses using the `process_address` method. At the end, it calls the `get_reuse_distance` method to print the final reuse distance.
Is there anything else you would like to add to this program?
